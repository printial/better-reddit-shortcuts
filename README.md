## Features

- Nested submenus 
- Seperate names for subreddits (useful for sports subreddits where the subreddit might be a nickname or initials)
- Low system usage compared to RES
- Works with both old reddit and new reddit (eventually)

## Install

- Chrome: install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), then navigate to the the [BRS userscript](https://github.com/printial/better-reddit-shortcuts/raw/main/better-reddit-shortcuts.user.js) and install

## Current Issues

- Currently only works on old reddit with RES installed
- Submenu css needs fixing to prevent overlapping
- Submenu management needs to be less complicated

## Plan

- Finish basic features - **Current status**
- Convert to Chrome/Firefox extensions
- Get working on new reddit, reddit without RES.
- Add subreddit colours/icons
- Improve submenu management
- Add/improve submenu import/exports and sharing
