## Features

- Nested submenus 
- Seperate names for subreddits - useful for when subreddits names aren't clear about the content (like sports subreddits that use initials or nicknames), examples:
  - [/r/urz](https://www.reddit.com/r/urz) is the subreddit for Reading F.C.
  - [/r/PARS](https://www.reddit.com/r/PARS) is the subreddit for Dunfermline Athletic F.C.
  - [/r/pne](https://www.reddit.com/r/pne) is the subreddit for Preston North End F.C.
  - [/r/superhoops](https://www.reddit.com/r/superhoops) is the subreddit for Queens Park Rangers F.C.
- Low system usage compared to RES
- Works with both old reddit and new reddit (eventually)
- Ability to easy share menus with others or between accounts

## Install

- Chrome: install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), then navigate to the the [BRS userscript](https://github.com/printial/better-reddit-shortcuts/raw/main/better-reddit-shortcuts.user.js) and install

## Current Issues

- Currently only works on old reddit with RES installed
- Submenu css needs fixing to prevent overlapping
- Submenu management needs to be less complicated

## Plan

- Finish basic features - **Current status**
- Convert to Chrome/Firefox extensions
- Get working on new reddit, reddit without RES.
- Add subreddit colours/icons
- Improve submenu management (sorting, better UI)
- Add/improve submenu import/exports and sharing
